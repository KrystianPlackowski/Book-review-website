# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

A backend project of a simple website providing ability to register and log in (with special cases handing exceptions) for users, performing search for books, viewing details page for selected book and writing reviews. Additionally, provides API responses when entering specified route.

The details page uses `Goodreads Review Data API`, so a key obtained at https://www.goodreads.com/api needs to be set as an enviromental variable named `BOOK_API`. Secondly, one needs to set `DATABASE_URL` enviromental variable as URI of its database.
