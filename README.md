# Project 1

# Description

A backend project of a simple website providing ability to register and log in (with special cases handing exceptions) for users, performing search for books, viewing details page for a selected book and writing reviews. Additionally, provides API responses when entering a specified route.

The details page uses `Goodreads Review Data API`, so a key obtained at https://www.goodreads.com/api needs to be set as an enviromental variable named `BOOK_API_KEY`. Secondly, one needs to set `DATABASE_URL` enviromental variable as URI of a SQL database of its choice.
